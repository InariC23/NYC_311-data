The data being requested was from Open data NYC. The dataset has 28 million rows, the information is automatically updated daily. I’m focusing on the years 2019 to 2021,I will be exploring what trends come up. The goal of this project is to analyze what issues are New Yorkers and inform the public about 311 for those who don’t know. 

## In my analysis, I wanted to answer following questions: ##
